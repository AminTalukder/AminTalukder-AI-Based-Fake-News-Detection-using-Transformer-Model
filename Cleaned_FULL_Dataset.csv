This metaphorical cat is both dead and alive and it will help quantum engineers detect computing errors,"UNSW engineers have demonstrated a well-known quantum thought experiment in the real world. Their findings deliver a new and more robust way to perform quantum computations. They have important implications for error correction, one of the biggest obstacles standing between them and a working quantum computer. For this research paper, Prof. Andrea Morellos team used an atom of antimony, which is much more complex than standard qubits, or quantum building blocks. The spin of Antimony can take eight different directions, instead of just two. This may not seem much, but in fact it completely changes the behaviour of the system. A superposition of the antimony spin pointing in opposite directions is not just a superpositionof up and down, because there are multiple quantum states separating the two branches of the superposition. This has profound consequences for scientists working on building a quantum computer using the nuclear spin of an atom as the basic building block. The research was published recently in the journal Nature Physics, and is available online at http:www.npr.org.uk.",1

Breaking the scaling limits of analog computing,"optical neural networks could perform the same tasks as a digital one, such as image classification or speech recognition, but because computations are performed using light instead of electrical signals, they can run many times faster. With this technique, as an optical circuit becomes larger, the amount of error in its computations actually decreases. This is remarkable, as it runs counter to the intuition of analog systems, where larger circuits are supposed to have higher errors, so that errors set a limit on scalability. This present paper allows us to address the scalability question of these systems with an unambiguous yes, says lead author Ryan Hamerly, a visiting scientist in the MIT Research Laboratory for Electronics (RLE) and Quantum Photonics Laboratory and senior scientist at NTT Research. The research is published today in Nature Communications., , Multiplying with light, , Their work could enable a super-fast, energy-efficient, analog neural network that can function with the same accuracy as adigital one.",1

If were really generous, everybody will effectively look like each other, says Devavrat Shah, a professor of electrical engineering and computer science and senior author on the paper.Because of our model, we knew exactly what is the right thing to do, says Shah. As it turns out, the right way to do it is to again use cosine similarities. If you connect the points to the origin the point with coordinates (0, 0) you define an angle, and the angle is the difference between the two points",1

Reducing delays in wireless networks,"MIT researchers have designed a congestion-control scheme for wireless networks. Could help reduce lag times and increase quality in video streaming, video chat, mobile gaming, and other web services. The scheme relies on a novel algorithm that enables the routers to explicitly communicate how many data packets should flow through a network to avoid congestion but fully utilize the network. The researchers are already in talks with mobile network operators to test the scheme. It provides detailed information from bottlenecks such as packets queued between cell towers and senders by repurposing a single bit already available in internet packets. In a paper at the USENIX Symposium on Networked Systems Design and Implementation, the researchers presented Accel-Brake Control (ABC), a simple scheme that achieves about 50 percent higher throughput, and about half the network delays, on time-varying links. They say the scheme could be used to improve video streaming and video chat services.",1
Using computational tools for molecule discovery,"Connor Coley is developing computational tools that would be able to predict molecular behavior and learn from the successes and mistakes. Suggestions could be made from the outset, offering a running start and shortening the overall timeline from idea to result. Coley cites estimates that there are 1020 to 1060 that are small and biologically relevant, but fewer than 109 have been synthesized and tested. This would let us boost our productivity and scale out the discovery process much more efficiently, he says. There are still inherent limitations. The guided optimization relies on models that are currently available, and molecules, unlike images, arent numerical or static. Their shapes change based on factors like environment and temperature, so the tool can learn patterns, and the result would be a more nuanced understan, says Coley.

Artificial intelligence sheds light on how the brain processes language,"Predictive language models can not only predict the word that comes next, but also perform tasks that seem to require some degree of genuine understanding. The better the model is at predicting the next word, the more closely it fits the human brain, says Nancy Kanwisher, the Walter A. Rosenblith Professor of Cognitive Neuroscience at MIT. It very indirectly suggests that maybe what the human language system is doing is predicting whats going to happen next, says another author of the study, Evelina Fedorenko of the McGovern Institute for Brain Research. Computer models that perform well on other types of language tasks do not show this similarity to the humanbrain, the study says. This suggests that the humanBrain may use next-word prediction to drive language processing The study was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.",1

Neuroscientists find a way to make object-recognition models perform better,"Computer vision models known as convolutional neural networks can be trained to recognize objects nearly as accurately as humans do. However, these models have one significant flaw: Very small changes to an image, which would be nearly imperceptible to a human viewer, can trick them into making egregious errors such as classifying a cat as a tree. A team of neuroscientists from MIT, Harvard University, and IBM have developed a way to alleviate this vulnerability, by adding to these models a new layer that is designed to mimic the earliest stage of the brains visual processing system. In a new study, they showed that this layer greatly improved the models robustness against this type of mistake., , Just by making the models more similar to the brains primary visual cortex, in this single stage of processing, we see quite significant improvements in robustness across many different types of perturbations and corruptions, says Tiago Marques, an MIT postdoc.",1

Gamifying medical data labeling to advance AI,"Erik Duhaime PhD 19 was working on his thesis in MITs Center for Collective Intelligence. He noticed his wife, then a medical student, spending hours studying on apps that offered flash cards and quizzes. His research had shown that, as a group, medical students could classify skin lesions more accurately than professional dermatologists. He founded Centaur Labs, a company that created a mobile app called DiagnosUs to gather the opinions of medical experts on real-world scientific and biomedical data. Through the app, users review anything from images of potentially cancerous skin lesions or audio clips of heart and lung sounds that could indicate a problem. If the users are accurate, Centaur uses their opinions and awards them small cash prizes. Those opinions, in turn, help medical AI companies train and improve their algorithms. The approach combines the desire of medical. experts to hone their skills with the desperate need for well-labeled medical data by companies using AI for biotech, developing pharmaceuticals, or commercializing medical devices.",1
Better fact-checking for fake news,"MIT team developed attacks that they showed could fool state-of-the-art fake-news detectors.

They assume that validation data and test data are independently and identically distributed (IID), which does not apply to spatial data.To combat this, the group devised a novel validation method based on the premise that spatial data varies smoothly with locations. Their approach outperformed conventional methods in experiments on real and synthetic data, including predicting wind speed and air temperature.This new method can be used to improve forecasts in climate science, epidemiology, and urban planning. In the future, the researchers plan to use their work for uncertainty quantification and time-series data. The work will be presented at the International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics and was supported by the NSF and Office of Naval Research.",1

Making better decisions when outcomes are uncertain,"Markov decision processes are mathematical models used to determine the best courses of action when both current circumstances and future consequences are uncertain. In an MDP, a given decision doesnt always yield a predictable result it could yield a range of possible results. And each of those results has a different value, meaning the chance that it will lead, ultimately, to a desirable outcome., Characterizing the value of given decision requires collection of empirical data, which can be prohibitively time consuming, so analysts usually just make educated guesses, With the researchers approach, it would need to be run 167,000 times. Thats still a big number except, perhaps, in the context of a server farm processing millions of web clicks per second, where MDP analysis could help allocate computational resources. In other contexts, the work at least represents a big step in the right direction",1

"Translating proteins into music, and back","Researchers at MIT have developed a system for converting the molecular structures of proteins into audible sound that resembles musical passages. Then, reversing the process, they can introduce some variations into the music and convert it back into new proteins never before seen in nature. The sounds are transposed in order to bring them within the audible range for humans, but the tones and their relationships are based on the actual vibrational frequencies of each amino acid molecule. The system was developed by Markus Buehler, the McAfee Professor of Engineering and head of the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at MIT. It provides a systematic way of translating a proteins sequence of amino acids into a musical sequence, using the physical properties of the molecules to determine the sounds. The whole concept is to get a better handle on understanding proteins and their vast array of variations. Proteins make up the structural material of skin, bone, and muscle, but are also enzymes, signaling chemicals, molecular switches, and a host of other functional materials. But their structures, including the way they fold themselves into the shapes that often determine their functions, are exceedingly complicated.",1

Collaborative machine learning that preserves privacy,"Researchers from MIT and the MIT-born startup DynamoFL have now taken one popular solution to this problem, known as federated learning, and made it faster and more accurate. Hundreds or thousands of users each train their own model using their own data on their own device. Then users transfer their models to a central server, which combines them to come up with a better model that it sends back to all users. A collection of hospitals located around the world, for example, could use this method to train a machine-learning model that identifies brain tumors in medical images, while keeping patient data secure on their local servers. The researchers were able to reduce the model size by nearly an order of magnitude when compared to other techniques, which led to communication costs that were between four and six times lower for individual users. Their technique was also able to increase the models overall accuracy by about 10 percent., , A lot of papers have addressed one of the problems of federatedlearning, but the challenge was to put all of this together",1

3 Questions: How the MIT mini cheetah learns to run,"Researchers from MITs Improbable AI Lab, part of the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) have been working on fast-paced strides for a robotic mini cheetah. Their model-free reinforcement learning system broke the record for the fastest run recorded. Achieving fast running requires pushing the hardware to its limits, for example by operating near the maximum torque output of motors. In such conditions, the robot dynamics are hard to analytically model. The robot needs to respond quickly to changes in the environment, such as the moment it encounters ice while running on grass. Humans run fast on grass and slow down on ice we adapt. Giving robots a similar capability to adapt requires quick identification of terrain changes and quickly adapting to prevent the robot from falling over. In summary, because its impractical to build analytical models of all possible terrains in advance, and the robots dynamics become more complex at high-velocities, high-speed running is more challenging than walking.",1

Flight of fancy,"The Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International-sponsored annual aerial-robotics competition has classically presented autonomous aerial vehicles with challenging tasks, which have been challenging tasks for several years in the past. But in a first, MITs Robust Robotics Group team overcame the latest challenge in its first year.This years contest simulated a post-nuclear meltdown scenario where an aerial robot had to fly through a window, navigate through a maze simulating an evacuated building, locate a control room, locate a radiation gauge, photograph it, and return the photo to a base stationall without GPS data. The MIT graduate and undergraduate student team used a quad helicopter, an off-the-shelf battery-powered four-rotor drone, to achieve this.Developing software to enable the quad to self-navigate in indoor settings involved overcoming fundamental research challenges. The drone mapped two dimensions of space using a laser rangefinder, but air movement made it twist and tip and distort the map. To compensate for this, the team developed algorithms that merged information from onboard accelerometers and gyros such that the quad was able to perceive motion in three dimensions. Such algorithms needed capabilities for processing data in rapid time to realign the position of the drone prior to it veering away too much from its trajectory. Testing took place at MITs motion capture studio, where the team compared the drones internal estimates with precise external measurements.They found that their system was accurate to about five centimetersjust enough to pass the first window test of the competition. Real-time location mapping was performed by the onboard processor of the drone, and higher-level path planning was performed by a base station in the vicinity. The planning algorithm adjusted for sensor limitations so that the quad remained pointed in the correct direction even when flying down long corridors where its rangefinder could not see far walls. Although the MIT teams achievement was universally praised, specialists stated that improvements are required before it can be used practically in the real world. Eric Johnson, who is a faculty advisor to Georgia Techs competing team, said one of the challenges is to make the system faster and stronger.Additionally, complete three-dimensional navigation, such as climbing and descending stairs, remains a challenge. MITs Nicholas Roy also agreed that merging camera data would make the quad better at identifying complicated surroundings, something his group is going to work on more in the future.",1

A method for designing neural networks optimally suited for certain tasks,"MIT researchers have found some answers. They conducted an analysis of neural networks and proved that they can be designed so they are optimal This means they minimize the probability of misclassifying borrowers or patients into the wrong category when the networks are given a lot of labeled training data. To achieve optimality, these networks must be built with a specific architecture. The results hold even as the neural networks grow very large. This work could help developers select the correct activation function, enabling them to build neural networks that classify data more accurately in a wide range of application areas.

Study urges caution when comparing neural networks to the brain,"Neural networks are a type of computing system loosely modeled on the organization of the human brain. They form the basis of many artificial intelligence systems for applications such as speech recognition, computer vision, and medical image analysis. Researchers at MIT found that neural networks only produced grid-cell-like activity when they were given very specific constraints that are not found in biological systems. In order to obtain a result with grid cells, the researchers training the models needed to bake in those results with specific, biologically implausible implementation choices, says Rylan Schaeffer, a former senior research associate at MIT. Without those constraints, the MIT team found that very few neural networks generated grid- cell-likeactivity, suggesting that these models do not necessarily generate useful predictions of how the brain works, says Schaeffer, who is now a graduate student in computer science at Stanford University. The study will be presented at the 2022 Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems this month.",1

EyeEcho uses one speaker and one microphone next to the glasses hinges to catch skin movement as facial expressions change, and the reflected signals are interpreted using AI. These devices can last for several hours on a smartglasses battery and more than a day on a VR headset. The technology could also help diagnose or monitor neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimers and Parkinsons.",1

Strengthening electron-triggered light emission,"Researchers at MIT and elsewhere have come up with an innovative way to make much stronger interactions between photons and electrons possible. In the process producing a hundredfold increase in the emission of light from a phenomenon called Smith-Purcell radiation. The finding has potential implications for both commercial applications and fundamental scientific research, although it will require more years of research to make it practical. Unlike other approaches to producing sources of light or other electromagnetic radiation, the free-electron-based method is fully tunable it can produce emissions of any desired wavelength, say the researchers. This may make it especially valuable for making sources of emission at wavelengths that are difficult to produce efficiently, including terahertz waves, ultraviolet light, and X-rays, they say. The basic principle involved could potentially enable far greater enhancements using devices specifically adapted for this function, they add. But they say that the basic principle could potentially enabled far greater enhancement using devices specially adapted for the function",1
Bridging the gap between human and machine vision,"Yena Han, a PhD candidate in electrical engineering and computer science at MIT, has found that humans can recognize a specific face from a single image. She says that state-of-the-art classifiers, such as vanilla deep networks, will fail this simple test. Understanding how human vision can pull off this remarkable feat is relevant for engineers aiming to improve their existing classifiers. It also is important for neuroscientists modeling the primate visual system with deep networks. In particular, it is possible that the invariance with one-shot learning exhibited by biological vision requires a rather different computational strategy than that of deep networks, she says. This is a huge difference with vast implications for engineering of vision systems and for understanding howhuman vision really works, says co-author Tomaso Poggio, the Eugene McDermott Professor of Brain and Cognitive Sciences at MIT. A key reason for this difference is the relative invariance of the primated visual system to scale, shift, and other transformations, says Han.",1

"New hardware offers faster computation for artificial intelligence, with much less energy","analog deep learning promises faster computation with a fraction of the energy usage. By repeating arrays of programmable resistors in complex layers, researchers can create a network of analog artificial neurons and synapses that execute computations just like a digital neural network. This network can then be trained to achieve complex AI tasks like image recognition and natural language processing. MIT researchers set out to push the speed limits of a type of human-made analog synapse that they had previously developed. They utilized a practical inorganic material in the fabrication process that enables their devices to run 1 million times faster than previous versions. The new material is compatible with silicon fabrication techniques. This change has enabled fabricating devices at the nanometer scale and could pave the way for integration into commercial computing hardware for deep-learning applications.

Neurodegenerative disease can progress in newly identified patterns,"ALS, or Lou Gehrigs disease, is always fatal, but while most people survive for only a few years after diagnosis, others live with the disease for decades. Understanding the progression of diseases like ALS is critical to enrollment in clinical trials, analysis of potential interventions, and discovery of root causes. Current clinical studies typically assume that health declines on a downward linear trajectory on a symptom rating scale, and use these linear models to evaluate whether drugs are slowing disease progression. However, data indicate that ALS often follows nonlinear trajectories, with periods where symptoms are stable alternating with periods when they are rapidly changing. Now, a new machine-learning method developed by researchers from MIT, IBM Research, and elsewhere aims to better characterize ALS disease progression patterns to inform clinical trial design, says Divya Ramamoorthy PhD 22, a research specialist at MIT and lead author of a new paper on the work.",1

Want cheaper nuclear energy? Turn the design process into a game,"Nuclear energy provides more carbon-free electricity in the United States than solar and wind combined. But the U.S. nuclear fleet is aging, and operators are under pressure to streamline their operations to compete with coal- and gas-fired plants.

Security tool guarantees privacy in surveillance footage,"The system lets analysts submit video data queries, and adds a little bit of noise (extra data) to the end result to ensure that an individual cant be identified. The system builds on a formal definition of privacy differential privacy which allows access to aggregate statistics about private data without revealing personally identifiable information. Honest analysts can get access to the information they need, but that access is restrictive enough that malicious analysts cant do too much with it. To enable this, rather than running the code over the entire video in one shot, Privid breaks the video into small pieces and runs processing code over each chunk. Instead of getting results back from each piece, the segments are aggregated, and that additional noise is added. (Theres no legal limit on how much extra noise can be added to a video.) The system is currently being trialled in the U.S. by the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.",1

3 Questions: Amar Gupta on an integrated approach to enhanced health-care delivery,"MIT researcher and former professor Amar Gupta explores through his research on how different states approach quality, safety, and coordination issues related to telemedicine and health care. Gupta: We need to take an integrated approach to address the interoperability challenge and enhance care delivery The pandemic exacerbated the difficulties of providing appropriate medical board oversight to ensure proper standard of services for patients, Gupta says. The prevailing restrictions, related to privacy of patient medical records and the ability for doctors from other states to see those records, were temporarily removed or made less prohibitive. This, in turn, can lead to situations where more medical images can go on an unauthorized basis into the public domain, Gupta adds. We find this creates issues with respect to treatment, as well as quality and safety of the patient, because the records are scattered or not easily accessed, Gupta says, And then we have the overarching challenge of interoperability across medical practices and organizations, states, and countries",1

In search of the neural mechanism that drives insect behaviour, PhD student Thorben Schoepe developed a model of its neuronal activity and a small robot that uses this model to navigate. The model is so good, Chicca concludes, that once you set it up, it will perform in all kinds of environments. Thats the beauty of this result The model is based on one main principle: always steer towards the area with the least apparent motion. In other (virtual) environments, such as a space with obstacles or small openings, the model also showed similar behaviour to insects. The fact that a robot can navigate in a realistic environment is not new. Rather, the study shows that insects are hardwired instead of learned.",1

Teaching AI to ask clinical questions,"Physicians often query a patients electronic health record for information that helps them make treatment decisions, but the cumbersome nature of these records hampers the process. Researchers have begun developing machine-learning models that can streamline the process by automatically finding information physicians need in an EHR. However, training effective models requires huge datasets of relevant medical questions, which are often hard to come by due to privacy restrictions. Existing models struggle to generate authentic questions those that would be asked by a human doctor and are often unable to successfully find correct answers. To overcome this data shortage, researchers at MIT partnered with medical experts to study the questions physicians ask when reviewing EHRs. Then, they built a publicly available dataset of more than 2,000 clinically relevant questions written by these medical experts. When they used their dataset to train a machine- learning model to generate clinical questions, they found that the model asked high-quality and authentic questions, as compared to real questions from medical experts, more than 60 percent of the time.",1

A single processing node in one layer of the network will generally receive data from several nodes in the layer below and pass it to the next layer above. Each connection between nodes has its own weight, which indicates how large a role the output of one node will play in the computation performed by the next. Training the network is a matter of setting those weights., A node receiving data from multiple nodes in a layer below will multiply each input by t., Since these machine-learning algorithms need so many computations, this transferring back and forth of data is the dominant portion of the energy consumption.",1

"AI Detects an Unknown Artificial Structure Near Pluto, Sparks Alien Theories","A deep-space AI model developed by Harvards Astrobiology Institute has reportedly detected an anomalous structure near Pluto, which appears to be a massive artificial construct orbiting the dwarf planet. The AIs image-enhancement algorithms suggest a symmetrical shape with patterns resembling circuitry, leading some experts to believe it could be an abandoned extraterrestrial outpost. While NASA has dismissed the findings as data anomalies, whistleblowers claim that a classified mission is already being planned to investigate. Speculation is rampant, with some believing that this could be a lost human-made structure from a secret space program.",0
Toward speech recognition for uncommon spoken languages,"Researchers at MIT and elsewhere have now tackled this problem by developing a simple technique that reduces the complexity of an advanced speech-learning model. Their technique involves removing unnecessary parts of a common, but complex, speech recognition model and then making minor adjustments so it can recognize a specific language. Because only small tweaks are needed once the larger model is cut down to size, it is much less expensive and time-consuming to teach this model an uncommon language. This work could help level the playing field and bring automatic speech-recognition systems to many areas of the world where they have yet to be deployed. This technology could even be used to transcribe and document rare languages that are in danger of vanishing., , This is an important problem to solve because we have amazing technology in natural language processing and speech recognition, but taking the research in this direction will help us scale the technology to many more underexplored languages in the world, says Cheng-I Jeff Lai, a PhD student in MITs Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.",1
Physicists Claim AI-Powered Quantum Computer Has Opened a Portal to the Past,"A group of physicists at CERN has made an astonishing claim: their latest AI-powered quantum computing experiment may have accidentally created a portal to the past. The researchers, who were working on quantum entanglement theories, noticed an anomaly when an AI-assisted quantum algorithm predicted an event before it occurred. Further experiments suggested that quantum bits (qubits) in their system were somehow ""communicating"" with qubits from a fraction of a second in the past. Some scientists speculate that, if scaled up, this phenomenon could allow real-time communication with the pastor even travel back in time. While skeptics argue that its merely a glitch, government agencies have reportedly taken interest in the findings, prompting speculation about classified military applications.",0

Object recognition for free,"Scene recognition has received relatively little attention among computer science researchers. Object recognition is a central research topic in computer vision. To know that something is a bedroom, you need to see the bed, says Antonio Torralba, an associate professor of computer science and engineering at MIT. It could be that the representations for scenes are parts of scenes that dont make any sense, like corners or pieces of objects, he adds. Thats what we found, that the network is really finding these objects. The work implies that at the very least, scene-recognition and object- Recognition systems could work in concert, he says. But it also holds out the possibility that they could prove to be mutually reinforcing The results will be presented at the International Conference on Learning Representations this weekend, says Torralbas. They will present a new paper demonstrating that, en route to learning how to recognize scenes, their system also learned how torecognize objects",1

How the brain switches between different sets of rules,"A new study from MIT has found that a region of the thalamus is key to the process of switching between the rules required for different contexts. This region, called the mediodorsalThalamus, suppresses representations that are not currently needed. That suppression also protects the representations as a short-term memory that can be reactivated when needed. It seems like a way to toggle between irrelevant and relevant contexts, and one advantage is that it protects the currently irrelevant representations from being overwritten, says Michael Halassa, an assistant professor of brain and cognitive sciences and a member of MITs McGovern Institute for Brain Research., Halassa is the senior author of the paper, which appears in the Nov. 19 issue of Nature Neuroscience. The papers first author is former MIT graduate student Rajeev Rikhye, who is now a postdoc in HalassAs lab. Aditya Gilra, a post doc at the University of Bonn, is also an author",1

Explained: How to tell if artificial intelligence is working the way we want it to,"Deep-learning models are often composed of millions or billions of interconnected nodes in many layers that are trained to perform detection or classification tasks using vast amounts of data. Because the models are so enormously complex, even the researchers who design them dont fully understand how they work. This has led to a new and rapidly growing area of study in which researchers develop and test explanation methods (also called interpretability methods) that seek to shed some light on how black-box machine- learning models make predictions. At their most basic level, explanation methods are either global or local. A local explanation method focuses on explaining how the model made one specific prediction, while global explanations seek to describe the overall behavior of an entire model. This is often done by developing a separate, simpler (and hopefully understandable) model that mimics the larger, black- box model., , But because deep learning models work in fundamentally complex and nonlinear ways, developing an effective global explanation model is particulary difficult",1

How to verify that quantum chips are computing correctly,"Researchers from MIT, Google, and elsewhere have designed a system that can verify when quantum chips have accurately performed complex computations that classical computers cant. Full-scale quantum computers will require millions of qubits, which isnt yet feasible. In the past few years, researchers have started developing Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) chips, which contain around 50 to 100 qubits. Thats just enough to demonstrate quantum advantage, meaning the NISQ chip can solve certain algorithms that are intractable for classical computers. Verifying that the chips performed operations as expected, however, can be very inefficient. The chipS outputs can look entirely random, so it takes a long time to simulate steps to determine if everything went according to plan.Our technique provides an important tool for verifying a broad class of quantum systems. Because if I invest billions of dollars to build a quantum chip, it sure better do something interesting",1
User-friendly system can help developers build more efficient simulations and AI models,"MIT scientists developed a system, SySTeC, to speed up deep learning models through optimization of computation. Deep learning models require enormous amounts of computation, consuming a great deal of power, but involve redundant data in the form of sparsity (high zero values) and symmetry (duplicated data structures). Existing optimization methods resolve only one such redundancy at a time, while SySTeC exploits both simultaneously.The compiler makes optimizations on code automatically by reducing redundant computations across tensors (multi-dimensional arrays used in AI). By avoiding redundant operations, SySTeC improved computation rates around 30x in evaluation. The system is also convenient for users to use, and hence is helpful for scientists who are not advanced deep learning developers.In the future, researchers plan to integrate SySTeC into existing tensor compiler infrastructures and optimize it for more advanced programs. This work is supported by Intel, NSF, DARPA, and the Department of Energy.",1
How many jobs do robots really replace?,"MIT study finds that in the U.S., the impact of robots varies widely by industry and region, and may play a notable role in exacerbating income inequality. From 1990 to 2007, the study shows, adding one additional robot per 1,000 workers reduced the national employment-to-population ratio by about 0.2 percent. Each additional robot added in manufacturing replaced about 3.3 workers nationally, on average., That increased use of robots in the workplace also lowered wages by roughly 0.4 percent during the same time period.We find negative wage effects, that workers are losing in terms of real wages in more affected areas, because robots are pretty good at competing against them, Daron Acemoglu says., The paper, Robots and Jobs: Evidence fromU.S. Labor Markets, appears in advance online form in the Journal of Political Economy. The authors are ACEmoglu and Pascual Restrepo PhD 16, an assistant professor of economics at Boston University",1

Learning words from pictures,"System analyzes correspondences between images and spoken descriptions of those images, as captured in a large collection of audio recordings. The system then learns which acoustic features of the recordings correlate with which image characteristics. The goal of this work is to try to get the machine to learn language more like the way humans do, says Jim Glass, a senior research scientist at CSAIL and a co-author on the paper describing the new system. The current methods that people use to train up speech recognizers are very supervised. You get an utterance, and youre told whats said. And you do this for a large body of data, says Glass. But that correlation could serve as the basis for others, he adds. If, for instance, an utterances is associated with an image, that image could be associated with the utterance. The version of the system reported in the new paper doesnt correlate recorded speech with written text instead, it correlates speech with groups of thematically related images",1

New method accelerates data retrieval in huge databases,"Hashing is a core operation in most online databases, like a library catalogue or an e-commerce website. Because traditional hash functions generate codes randomly, sometimes two pieces of data can be hashed with the same value. This causes collisions - when searching for one item, a user points a user to many pieces ofData with thesame hash value. It takes much longer to find the right one, resulting in slower searches and reduced performance. Researchers from MIT and elsewhere set out to see if they could use machine learning to build better hash functions. They found that, in certain situations, using learned models could result in half as many collisions. For instance, their technique could accelerate computational systems that scientists use to store and analyze DNA, amino acid sequences, or other biological information. The teams experiments also showed that learned models were often more computationally efficient than perfect hash functions., , In some situations we can come up with a better tradeoff between the computation of the hash function and the collisions we will face, says Ibrahim Sabek, a postdoc in the MIT Data Systems Group.",1

Deep learning helps predict traffic crashes before they happen,"MIT developed a deep learning model that predicts very high-resolution crash risk maps. The maps are 5x5 meter grid cells, and the higher resolution brings newfound clarity. The scientists found that a highway road, for example, has a higher risk than nearby residential roads, and ramps merging and exiting the highway have an even high risk than other roads. This could help insurance companies provide customized insurance plans based on driving trajectories of customers, help city planners design safer roads and even predict future crashes, says MIT CSAIL PhD student Songtao He, a lead author on a new paper about the research. Even though car crashes are sparse, they cost about 3 percent of the worlds GDP and are the leading cause of death in children and young adults, says He.

Deep-learning technique reveals invisible objects in the dark,"Engineers at MIT have developed a technique that can reveal these invisible objects, in the dark. They trained a computer to recognize more than 10,000 transparent glass-like etchings, based on extremely grainy images of those patterns. The images were taken in very low lighting conditions, with about one photon per pixel far less light than a camera would register in a dark, sealed room. They then showed the computer a new grainy image, not included in the training data, and found that it learned to reconstruct the transparent object that the darkness had obscured. The results demonstrate that deep neural networks may be used to illuminate transparent features such as biological tissues and cells, in images taken with very little light, says George Barbastathis, professor of mechanical engineering at MIT. In the lab, if you blast biological cells with light, you burn them, and there is nothing left to image, says Barbastithis. What were doing here is, you can get the same image quality, but with a lower exposure to the patient",1

Recognizing the partially seen,"Researchers at MIT have developed a model for how to improve the performance of machines in this setting. By recapitulating visual processing in the human brain, we are thus hoping to also improve models in computer vision. For models from computer vision to function in everyday life, they need to be able to digest occluded objects just as well as whole ones, says Martin Schrimpf, co-author of a paper on the subject. How are we as humans able to repeatedly do this everyday task without putting much thought and energy into this action? asks Gabriel Kreiman, an affiliate of the MIT Center for Brains, Minds, and Machines. We dug into the underlying computations in the brain and then used our findings to build computational models, says Kreiman. In their paper, ""Recurrent computations for visual pattern completion,"" the team showed how they developed a computational model, inspired by the human visual cortex, to improve computer vision models..",1

3 Questions: Nicholas Roy on deploying drones in U.S. skies,"The FAA has pledged to expand drone surveillance along the Texas-Mexico border while working on regulations for UAVs in civilian and law enforcement applications. MIT professor Nicholas Roy describes the challenges and benefits of introducing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) into U.S. airspace.UAVs also have some advantages, including a longer flight duration compared to manned aircraft and the ability to fly in various sizes, which makes them suitable for city environments or small areas. Their use in disaster response and surveillance enhances situational awareness, providing critical real-time intelligence. Integrating UAVs into controlled airspace, nevertheless, is a significant challenge. Unlike human pilots, UAVs are not highly flexible since they rely heavily on external technology such as GPS and network connectivity. Safe flight requires advanced sensors and collision-avoidance algorithms to be designed. Additionally, UAVs must also communicate effectively with air traffic control and other aircraft, which requires improved communication systems. Certification and safety of UAVs are another major concern.As aircraft become more complex, testing and finding possible malfunctions is that much more difficult. The transition to GPS-based air traffic control will enable better tracking and provide more flight routes, reducing the chance of collisions. UAV autopilots will be able to utilize digital identity information for improved situational awareness through the use of GPS technology. But GPS is not flawless, for it remains prone to noise and error and must be planned for with consideration to be trustworthy. While the FAAs regulatory advancements can facilitate UAV incorporation in national airspace, technological and operational complexities remain to be solved.",1

Artificial intelligence model detects asymptomatic Covid-19 infections through cellphone-recorded coughs,"Asymptomatic people who are infected with Covid-19 exhibit, by definition, no discernible physical symptoms of the disease. They are thus less likely to seek out testing for the virus, and could unknowingly spread the infection to others. MIT researchers have now found that those who are asymptastic may differ from healthy individuals in the way that they cough. These differences are not decipherable to the human ear, but it turns out that they can be picked up by artificial intelligence. The team is working on incorporating the model into a user-friendly app, which if FDA-approved and adopted on a large scale could potentially be a free, convenient, noninvasive prescreening tool. A user could log in daily, cough into their phone, and instantly get information on whether they might be infected and therefore should confirm with a formal test., The effective implementation of this group diagnostic tool could diminish the spread of the pandemic if everyone uses it before going to a classroom, a factory, or a restaurant, says co-author Brian Subirana, a research scientist in MITs Auto-ID Laboratory",1

Helping students stick with MOOCs,"MIT researchers show that a dropout-prediction model trained on data from one offering of a course can help predict which students will stop out of the next offering. The prediction remains fairly accurate even if the organization of the course changes, so that the data collected during one offering doesnt exactly match the Data collected during the next. The problem is that you dont know whos actually dropped out or, in MOOC parlance, stopped out until the MOOC has been completed. One missed deadline does not a stopout make but after the second or third missed deadline, it may be too late for an intervention to do any good, the researchers said. Identifying those people before they drop out and providing them with extra help could make their MOOC participation much more productive, they added. For instance, a student who spent two hours a week watched video lectures could be more productive than someone who spent just one hour a week.",1

MIT team building robotic fin for submarines,"MIT team hopes to create a more maneuverable, propeller-less underwater robot better suited for military tasks such as sweeping mines and inspecting harbors. They are hoping to mimic the action of the bluegill sunfish. The latest fin is made of a thin, flexible material that conducts electricity. The fin is able to replicate two motions that the researchers identified as critical to the propulsion of the sunfish fin: the forward sweep of the fins and the simultaneous cupping of the upper and lower edges of the fin. We dont want to replicate exactly what nature does, said James Tangorra, an MIT postdoctoral associate working on the project. ""We want to figure out what parts are important for propulsion and copy those."", said TangOrra, who will soon be joining the faculty of Drexel University. If we could produce AUVs that can hover and turn and store energy and do all the things a fish does, theyll be much better than the remotely operated vehicles we have now",1

Enabling human-robot rescue teams,"Researchers at MITs Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) presented a new way of modeling robot collaboration that reduces the need for communication by 60 percent. They believe that their model could make it easier to design systems that enable humans and robots to work together in, for example, emergency-response teams. The work could have also have implications for multirobot collaborations that dont involve humans. Communication consumes some power, which is always a consideration in battery-powered devices, but in some circumstances, the cost of processing new information could be a much more severe resource drain, they say. In some scenarios, a robots decision to broadcast a new item of information could force its fellows to update their models and churn through all those probabilities again. If the information is inessential, broadcasting it could introduce serious delays, to no purpose, the researchers say. The work suggests that 60 percent of communications in multiagent systems may be inessenti.",1

3 Questions: How AI image generators could help robots,"Yilun Du, a PhD student in MITs Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL), recently developed a new method that makes models like DALL-E 2 more creative and have better scene understanding. Here, Du describes how these models work, whether this technical infrastructure can be applied to other domains, and how we draw the line between AI and human creativity. The explosion of generative art has sparked debate around copyright, disinformation, and biases, all mired in hype and controversy. The field of AI-generated art can be traced back as far as the 1960s with early attempts using symbolic rule-based approaches to make technical images. A simple text prompt yields a nearly instantaneous image, satisfying our primitive brains, which are hardwired for instant gratification. But for every image used, theret usually a human behind it. For example, when you drop a dot of ink into water and it dissipates, for example, at the end, you just get this u.",1

Teaching language models grammar really does make them smarter,"Deep learning models that power Siri and Alexa learn to understand our commands by picking out patterns in sequences of words and phrases. Grammatical constraints seem to help the models learn faster and perform better, but because neural networks reveal very little about their decision-making process, researchers have struggled to confirm that the gains are due to the grammar, and not the models expert ability at finding patterns. Now psycholinguists have stepped in to help. To peer inside the models, they have taken psychol linguistic tests originally developed to study human language understanding and adapted them to probe what neural networks know about language. They find evidence that grammar-enriched deep learning models comprehend some fairly sophisticated rules, performing better than models trained on little-to-no grammar and using a fraction of the data. Grammar helps the model behavexa0in more human-like ways, saysMiguel Ballesteros, an IBM researcher with theMIT-IBM Watson AI Lab.",1

AI that can learn the patterns of human language,"Researchers at MIT, Cornell University, and McGill University have demonstrated an artificial intelligence system that can learn the rules and patterns of human languages on its own. For instance, it might learn that the letter a must be added to end of a word to make the masculine form feminine in Serbo-Croatian. The system could be used to study language hypotheses and investigate subtle similarities in the way diverse languages transform words. It is especially unique because the system discovers models that can be readily understood by humans, and it acquires these models from small amounts of data, such as a few dozen words. The researchers trained and tested the model using problems from linguistics textbooks that featured 58 different languages. Each problem had a set of words and corresponding word-form changes. The model was able to come up with a correct set of rules to describe those word- form changes for 60 percent of the problems., , This model can also automatically learn higher-level language patterns that can apply to many languages, enabling it to achieve better results",1

Robot ANYmal can do parkour and walk across rubble,"Researchers at ETH Zurich have taught this quadrupedal robot some new skills. ANYmal is proving rather adept at parkour, a sport based on using athletic manoeuvres. It is also proficient at dealing with the tricky terrain commonly found on building sites or in disaster areas. Anymal uses its camera and artificial neural network to determine what kind of impediment its dealing with. It then performs movements that seem likely to succeed based on its previous training, says researcher Nikita Rudin, who does parkour in his free time. The robot can now scale obstacles and perform dynamic manoeuvres to jump back down from them, says Rudin. But he adds that this still leaves plenty of potential improvements for the robot to move beyond solving predefined problems and instead ask it to negotiate difficult terrain like rubble-strewn disaster areas, such as building sites and rubble-ridden areas of the city of Zug, Switzerland, for example. For more information on the project, visit ETH Zurichs website.",1

3Q: Christine Walley on the evolving perception of robots in the US,"Christine J. Walley, professor of anthropology at MIT, explores how robots have often been a symbol for anxiety about artificial intelligence and automation. She provides a unique perspective in the recent research brief Robots as Symbols and Anxiety Over Work Loss. Walley highlights the historical context of technology and job displacement and illustrates examples of how other countries approach policies regarding robots, skills, and learning. In the late 19thxa0century, mechanization was used in many industries to displace skilled workers, who were more likely to be unionized and have higher wages. Our recent era has had a strong emphasis on shareholder valuuu. There is a need for policies that encourage the former, Walley says. In order to put the technology questions into perspective, we have to confront more explicitly the dynamics that are creating more precarious forms of employment, particularly for those on the lower end of the economic spectrum, she says. For an anthropologist, the point is not that peoples concerns are irrational, but that robots have become symbolic encapsulations of much broader anxieties about the changing nature of work in the United States.",1

Study: AI models fail to reproduce human judgements about rule violations,"Machine-learning models are sometimes designed to mimic human decision making, such as deciding whether social media posts violate toxic content policies. But researchers from MIT and elsewhere have found that these models often do not replicate human decisions about rule violations. If models are not trained with the right data, they are likely to make different, often harsher judgements than humans would. This drop in accuracy could have serious implications in the real world. For instance, if a descriptive model is used to make decisions about whether an individual is likely to reoffend, the researchers findings suggest it may cast stricter judgements. This could lead to higher bail amounts or longer criminal sentences. This has huge ramifications for machine learning systems in human processes, says Marzyeh Ghassemi, an assistant professor and head of the Healthy ML Group in the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL)., , G hassemi is senior author of a new paper detailing these findings, which was published today in Science Advances.",1

The big promise of these neural scene representations, at the end of the day, is to use them in vision tasks, says Vincent Sitzmann, a postdoc in the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) The research will be presented at the Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems this month, he says. In computer vision and computer graphics, rendering a 3d scene from a image involves mapping thousands or possibly millions of camera rays. The LFNs the researchers developed can reconstruct a light field after only a single observation of an image, and they are able to render 3D Scenes at real-time frame rates",1

Finding a good read among billions of choices,"MIT researchers present new technique for cutting through massive amounts of text. Algorithm summarizes a collection of, say, books, into topics based on commonly-used words in the collection. It then divides each book into its five to 15 most important topics, with an estimate of how much each topic contributes to the book overall. The technique works especially well when scanning large collections of books and lengthy documents, say the researchers. Anything to help cut through all that material is extremely useful, says MITs Justin Solomon, an assistant professor at the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab. With billions of books, news stories, and documents online, theres never been a better time to be reading, says Solomon. As natural language processing techniques improve, those you might also like suggestions are getting speedier and more relevant, he says. If an algorithm knows what you liked in the past, it can scan the millions of possibilities for something similar",1

Using artificial intelligence to engineer materials properties,"Researchers at MIT and in Russia and Singapore have found ways to use artificial intelligence to help predict and control these changes. Strain is something you can turn on and off dynamically, Ju Li says. Even a 1 percent change in the structure can in some cases improve the speed of the device by 50 percent, by allowing electrons to move through the material faster. Strain can be applied in any of six different ways (in three different dimensions, each one of which can produce strain in-and-out or sideways) The findings appear this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, in a paper authored by MIT professor of nuclear science and engineering, Ju Li, MIT Principal Research Scientist Ming Dao, and MIT graduate student Zhe Shi. These discoveries have opened up new avenues to explore how devices can be fabricated with even more dramatic changes in the materials properties, says Li, But the potential of strain-engineered materials has been hampered by the daunting range of possibilities",1
New AI tool calculates materials stress and strain based on photos,"MIT researchers have developed a technique to quickly determine certain properties of a material, like stress and strain, based on an image of the material showing its internal structure.

With these examples, the network uses principles of game theory to iteratively figure out the relationships between the geometry of amaterial and its resulting stresses",1
A technique to improve both fairness and accuracy in artificial intelligence,"Researchers at MIT and the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab have discovered that the technique can have the opposite effect for underrepresented groups of people in a dataset. As the models confidence increases with selective regression, its chance of making the right prediction also increases, but this does not always happen for all subgroups. For instance, a model suggesting loan approvals might make fewer errors on average, but it may actually make more wrong predictions for Black or female applicants. One reason this can occur is due to the fact that the models confidence measure is trained using overrepresented groups and may not be accurate for these under represented groups. The MIT researchers developed two algorithms that can remedy the issue. Using real-world datasets, they show that the algorithms reduce performance disparities that had affected marginalized subgroups., , Ultimately, this is about being more intelligent about which samples you hand off to a human to deal with, says senior MIT author Greg Wornell. The paper will be presented this month at the Internat.",1

Algorithm tells robots where nearby humans are headed,"Researchers at MIT and the auto manufacturer BMW were testing ways in which humans and robots might work in close proximity to assemble car parts. In a replica of a factory floor setting, the team rigged up a robot on rails, designed to deliver parts between work stations. Meanwhile, human workers crossed its path every so often to work at nearby stations. The robot was programmed to stop momentarily if a person passed by. But the researchers noticed that the robot would often freeze in place, overly cautious, long before a person had crossed its. path. If this took place in a real manufacturing setting, such unnecessary pauses could accumulate into significant inefficiencies. Now, members of that same MIT team have come up with a solution: an algorithm that accurately aligns partial trajectories in real-time, allowing motion predictors to accurately anticipate the timing of a persons motion.

While the nations ailing infrastructure will require more funding to reach its full potential, recent MIT research finds that more sustainable and higher performing roads are still possible even with todays limited budgets The key to its success is the consideration of a fundamental but fraught aspect of pavement asset management: uncertainty., The average road must last many years and support the traffic of thousands if not millions of vehicles. Over that time, a lot can change. Material prices may fluctuate, budgets may tighten, and traffic levels may intensify. Climate (and climate change), too, can hasten unexpected repairs.Managing these uncertainties effectively means looking long into the future and anticipating possible changes., Capturing the impacts of uncertainty is essential for making effective paving decisions",1

Better autonomous reasoning at tricky intersections,"MIT and Toyota researchers have designed a new model to help autonomous vehicles determine when its safe to merge into traffic at intersections with obstructed views. In 2016, roughly 23 percent of fatal and 32 percent of nonfatal U.S. traffic accidents occurred at intersections, according to a 2018 Department of Transportation study. The researchers developed a model that instead uses its own uncertainty to estimate the risk of potential collisions or other traffic disruptions at such intersections. It weighs several critical factors, including all nearby visual obstructions, sensor noise and errors, the speed of other cars, and even the attentiveness of other drivers. Based on the measured risk, the system may advise the car to stop, pull into traffic, or nudge forward to gather more data., When you approach an intersection there is potential danger for collision, says Daniela Rus, director of the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) and the Andrew and Erna Viterbi Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science",1

Students make progress on colonic robot,"""Colon robot"" being designed in MITs Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. Robot would be controlled by a surgeon who could perform procedures without having to cut open the patient or use a long flexible endoscope. The biggest challenge in designing a colon robot is inventing a means of locomotion that can handle the terrain (which is flexible and offers little purchase) without injuring the patient. Around the circumference of his latest prototype are longitudinal elastic treads powered by 10,000-rpm motors and worm drives, which reduce the speed but boost the torque. The result: a robot that moves forward at about two feet a minute, says Arthur Shectman, a senior in mechanical engineering. The elements limiting miniaturization at the moment are the motor and its accompanying reduction gears, says Rodney Brooks, professor of electrical engineering and computer science and associate director of the Artificial Intelligence laboratory. ""Still to be solved is the problem of how to mount implements that the surgeon will control from outside the patients body,"" he says.",1
Deep learning with light,"MIT researchers have created a new method for computing directly on these devices, which drastically reduces this latency. Their technique shifts the memory-intensive steps of running a machine-learning model to a central server where components of the model are encoded onto light waves.

Translating lost languages using machine learning,"MIT researchers have developed an algorithm that can automatically decipher lost languages. The teams ultimate goal is to be able to decipher languages that have eluded linguists for decades, using just a few thousand words. They also showed that their system can itself determine relationships between languages, and they used it to corroborate recent scholarship suggesting that the language of Iberian is not actually related to Basque. The algorithm learns to embed language sounds into a multidimensional space where differences in pronunciation are reflected in the distance between corresponding vectors. This design enables them to capture pertinent patterns of language change and exprere. The system relies on several principles grounded in insights from historical linguistics, such as the fact that languages generally only evolve in certain predictable ways. For instance, while a given language rarely adds or deletes an entire sound, certain sound substitutions are likely to occur. A word with a p in the parent language may change into a b in the descendant language, but less likely due to the significant pronunciation gap.",1

"AI Claims It Has Developed a Sense of Humor First Joke Falls Flat, Leaving Engineers Confused!","AI has made an unexpected claimit has developed a sense of humor. However, when it delivered its first joke, the response was far from what it anticipated. Engineers reported feeling confused rather than amused, as the joke lacked the nuance, timing, and cultural context that make human humor work. This experiment highlights one of the biggest challenges in AI development: teaching machines to understand humor, which often relies on wordplay, irony, and shared experiences. AI-generated humor so far tends to be either too literal, nonsensical, or unintentionally awkward, raising questions about whether artificial intelligence can ever truly grasp comedic timing. Researchers are now working on refining AI humor models by training them on vast datasets of jokes, memes, and stand-up comedy scripts to improve their understanding of context and wit. While the results are still inconsistent, this development brings AI one step closer to mimicking human conversation in a more natural way. Whether AI will eventually master humor remains uncertain, but for now, it seems that comedy remains an art that machines have yet to perfect.",0
